# Claude-ITect-Skill v2.0

A personalized curated skill pack for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Installs 48 skills, 4 agent definitions, caveman session hooks into any project in one command, and thefuck fixes any mistakes that occur....when you need it. Give it a shot, and let me know what could be better!

After installation start with running: 
- audit

## Requirements

- Claude Code (any platform)
- Node.js — required for caveman session hooks
- Git Bash / WSL — required for `install.sh` on Windows

---

## Install

### Windows

**Option A — double-click or run from any terminal (recommended):**

```bat
install.bat
```

**Option B — PowerShell with explicit bypass:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\Claud-itect-Skill-2\install.ps1"
```

**Install into a specific project:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\Claud-itect-Skill-2\install.ps1" -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\your\project"
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-ProjectPath C:\path` | Target a specific project directory (defaults to current directory) |
| `-Force` | Overwrite skills that already exist |
| `-SkipHooks` | Skip auto-wiring hooks into `settings.json` |

### macOS / Linux

```bash
bash "/path/to/Claud-itect-Skill-2/install.sh"
```

**Install into a specific project:**

```bash
bash "/path/to/Claud-itect-Skill-2/install.sh" /path/to/your/project
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/path/to/project` | Target a specific project directory (defaults to current directory) |
| `--force` | Overwrite skills that already exist |
| `--skip-hooks` | Skip auto-wiring hooks into `settings.json` |

### What gets installed

```
.claude/
├── skills/     48 skills
├── agents/     4 agent definitions
└── hooks/      6 hook files
```

`settings.json` is patched automatically to wire caveman hooks (SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit). Existing entries are preserved. NgonENGINE-specific commands in `commands-ngon/` are **not** auto-installed. Comment if you want these as well.

## TheFuck

Diagnoses and corrects failed shell commands. Wraps the [`thefuck`](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) CLI if installed.

**Triggers:** failed command in session, "fix that", "fuck", "what should I have typed", "correct that"

**Behavior:** identifies error class (typo, missing sudo, wrong flag, bad path, etc.), proposes corrected command, confirms before running. Never executes destructive corrections silently.

**Install the CLI (optional):**

```powershell
winget install thefuck          # Windows
```

```bash
brew install thefuck            # macOS
pip install thefuck             # any platform
```

**Add shell alias:**

```bash
# bash/zsh
eval $(thefuck --alias)
```

```powershell
# PowerShell ($PROFILE)
$env:TF_SHELL = "powershell"; iex "$(thefuck --alias)"
```

## Agents (4)

Installed to `.claude/agents/`. Spawn via `Agent` tool with `subagent_type`.

| Agent | `subagent_type` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| CaveCrew Builder | `cavecrew-builder` | 1–2 file surgical edits only. Hard refuses 3+ file scope. |
| CaveCrew Investigator | `cavecrew-investigator` | Read-only code locator. Returns `file:line` table. No fix suggestions. |
| CaveCrew Reviewer | `cavecrew-reviewer` | Diff reviewer. One finding per line, severity-tagged. No praise. |
| Geometry Solver | `geometry-solver` | NgonENGINE math — Newell normals, MVC, GJK/EPA, SubRegion, planarity. |

---

## Hooks (6)

Installed to `.claude/hooks/`. Require Node.js.

| File | Event | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `caveman-activate.js` | `SessionStart` | Injects active caveman ruleset into session context |
| `caveman-mode-tracker.js` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Re-injects caveman level reminder each turn |
| `caveman-config.js` | shared | Reads/writes caveman mode config |
| `caveman-stats.js` | on demand | Reads real token counts from session log |
| `caveman-statusline.ps1` | `statusLine` | `[CAVEMAN]` badge in Claude Code status bar (Windows) |
| `package.json` | shared | Hook dependencies |

The install script writes SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit entries into `.claude/settings.json` using the absolute path of the installed hooks directory.

**Status bar badge (optional, Windows):**

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \".claude\\hooks\\caveman-statusline.ps1\""
  }
}
```
